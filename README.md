# SnakeAI
This repository contains the code for my WnCC Summer of Code - 2021 Project.

The goal of the project is to learn Reinforcement Learning by building a RL Model that plays the popular Snake Game. I will be doing small exercises along the way whose source code can be found in this repository.

## Game Demo
I am playing the game. (fairly well if I say so myself)

## Assignment 1 - Maze Solver using Value Iteration
In this assignment, we had to implement a maze solver using Value Iteration. The program runs quickly on almost all grid sizes except the 10x10 one. I plan on writing an alternative program that uses a dictionary-based approach rather than vectorised matrix computations. I will also add my implementions of Howard's Policy Iteration and Linear Programming.

## Assignment 2 - Sutton & Barto's Windy Gridworld using Model-free control
In this assignment, we solve the Windy Gridworld problem using different Model-free approaches - SARSA(0), Q-Learning, Expected-SARSA, Dyna-Q. I plan on adding an implemention of SARSA(\Lambda) and comparing it with other approaches listed above.
